Reproduction test for GitHub issue #332: 6-K Filings - Financials
https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/issues/332

Issue: AttributeError: 'CurrentReport' object has no attribute 'financials'

This test verifies that:
1. 6-K forms can access financial data via the financials property
2. 8-K forms can also access financial data (regression test) 
3. Financial statements can be extracted from Current Reports (6-K/8-K)

The fix: Make CurrentReport inherit from CompanyReport to get financial functionality.
