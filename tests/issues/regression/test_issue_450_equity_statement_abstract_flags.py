Regression test for Issue #450: Statement of Equity Rendering Problems

GitHub Issue: #450
https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/issues/450

Issue Summary:
--------------
Three rendering problems in statement of equity:
1. Missing values for "Total Stockholders' Equity" (appears twice but both empty)
2. Wrong abstract positioning (abstracts appear AFTER their children instead of before)
3. Incorrect abstract flagging (`abstract` column shows `False` for all rows, even abstracts)

Root Cause:
-----------
US-GAAP taxonomy schemas were not being parsed, causing abstract attribute information
to be missing for standard taxonomy concepts. Concepts were added to the element catalog
from linkbases with default abstract=False values.

Fix:
----
Implemented multi-tier abstract detection strategy:
1. Pattern-based matching (concepts ending in Abstract, RollForward, Table, etc.)
2. Known abstract concepts list
3. Schema abstract attribute (when available)
4. Structural heuristics

Changes:
--------
- Added edgar/xbrl/abstract_detection.py module
- Updated edgar/xbrl/parsers/presentation.py to use enhanced abstract detection
- Updated edgar/xbrl/parser.py to use enhanced abstract detection
- Fixed edgar/xbrl/xbrl.py line 798 to use node.is_abstract instead of hardcoding False

    Tests:

    3. Incorrect abstract flagging

    All three issues stemmed from US-GAAP taxonomy schemas not being parsed.
