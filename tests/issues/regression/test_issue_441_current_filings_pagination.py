Regression test for Issue #441: CurrentFilings pagination assertion error

This test ensures that CurrentFilings pagination works correctly and does not
throw AssertionError when iterating through pages.

Fixed issues:
1. AssertionError in CurrentFilings.__getitem__ when get() returned None
2. Iterator not handling page-relative indices correctly
3. Proper error handling for out-of-bounds access

The fix involved:
1. Replacing assertion with proper IndexError/KeyError exceptions in __getitem__
2. Overriding __iter__ and __next__ to handle page-relative iteration correctly
3. Using super().get_filing_at() directly with page-relative indices during iteration
