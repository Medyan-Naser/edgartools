Regression test for Issue #412: TSLA Data Access

This test ensures that TSLA financial data remains accessible after the SGML parsing fix.
The original issue reported "TSLA revenue just isn't there from 2019 to 2022" due to 
SGML parsing failures that prevented access to XBRL data.

The fix resolved SGML parsing errors with XBRL inline content, unlocking access to
Tesla's financial data that was previously completely inaccessible.
