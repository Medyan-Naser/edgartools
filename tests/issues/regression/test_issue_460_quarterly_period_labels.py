Regression test for Issue #460: Quarterly income statement fiscal periods showing 1 year offset.

This test verifies that quarterly period labels correctly reflect when the period occurred,
not the SEC's forward-looking fiscal_year values. The SEC Facts API provides fiscal_year
values that indicate which fiscal year the quarter contributes to, not the year for labeling.

For example, for Apple (fiscal year ends in September):
- Q3 ending June 2024 should be labeled "Q3 2024" (not "Q3 2025")
- Q1 ending December 2023 should be labeled "Q1 2024" (first quarter of FY 2024)

The fix implements `calculate_fiscal_year_for_label()` which correctly calculates
fiscal years from period_end dates based on the company's fiscal year end month.
