Regression test for Issue #452: DNUT FY 2023 revenue incorrect value

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/dgunning/edgartools/issues/452

Problem:
--------
EdgarTools was returning $1.530B for DNUT's FY 2023 revenue instead of the correct $1.686B.

Root Cause:
-----------
When Krispy Kreme (DNUT) changed their fiscal year-end from January to December,
the SEC Facts API provided duplicate periods with inconsistent fiscal_year values:
- Period ending Jan 1, 2023: Had fiscal_year=2022 (correct) AND fiscal_year=2023 (wrong)
- Period ending Dec 31, 2023: Had fiscal_year=2023 (correct)

EdgarTools was selecting the wrong period (Jan 1, 2023 with fiscal_year=2023)
which had $1.530B revenue instead of the correct period (Dec 31, 2023) with $1.686B.

Fix:
----
Added fiscal year validation in enhanced_statement.py to filter out mislabeled
comparative data where fiscal_year doesn't align with period_end.

Test Strategy:
--------------
This test verifies that DNUT's FY 2023 revenue matches the official SEC filing value
of $1.686B, confirming that the correct period (Dec 31, 2023) is now selected.
