# Enhanced Feature Development Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines an enhanced feature development workflow that builds on EdgarTools' existing practices while adding systematic tracking, follow-up planning, and project management structure. The approach maintains developer velocity while ensuring features achieve their intended impact and create opportunities for future enhancement.

**Based on**: Portfolio Manager Enhancement (FEAT-021) case study  
**Applies to**: Features requiring >1 week of development or affecting core user workflows

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Feature Intake and Evaluation

#### 1.1 Source Identification and Capture

**Input Sources**:
- Reddit community feedback
- GitHub issues and discussions  
- Internal development needs
- User research and interviews

**Documentation**: Create initial feature brief using template below

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **User Impact**: High (Core workflow) / Medium (Enhancement) / Low (Edge case)
- **Strategic Alignment**: Core principles / User experience / Developer experience
- **Implementation Complexity**: Simple (<1 week) / Medium (1-4 weeks) / Complex (>1 month)
- **Dependencies**: External APIs, major refactors, breaking changes

### Phase 2: Implementation with Systematic Tracking

#### 2.1 Pre-Implementation Setup

**Branch Naming**: `feat/FEAT-XXX-feature-name`  
**Documentation**: Create or update relevant CLAUDE.md files  
**Testing Plan**: Define test coverage approach and key scenarios

**Use TodoWrite Tool for Complex Features**:
```python
# For features with >3 major steps
TodoWrite([
    {"content": "Research and analyze current limitations", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Design external database architecture", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Implement core functionality", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Add comprehensive test coverage", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Create maintenance tooling", "status": "pending"}
])
```

#### 2.2 Implementation Standards

**Code Quality**:
- Follow existing patterns in codebase
- Update relevant CLAUDE.md files with new patterns
- Add comprehensive docstrings with examples
- Include deprecation warnings for replaced functionality

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with real data where possible
- Performance tests for features affecting main workflows
- Edge case coverage for error conditions

**Documentation Standards**:
- Update API reference documentation
- Create user-facing examples and tutorials
- Document limitations and data sources clearly
- Add troubleshooting guidance for common issues

#### 2.3 Enhanced Commit Message Format

```bash
feat(module): implement [feature name] with [key capability]

Core Changes:
- [Primary functionality added]
- [Key technical innovation]
- [User-facing improvements]

Impact:
- [Quantifiable achievement]
- [User problem addressed]
- [Performance or quality improvement]

Follow-up Opportunities:
- ENHANCE-XXX-A: [Next logical enhancement]
- ENHANCE-XXX-B: [Alternative improvement path]

Success Metrics:
- [Metric 1]: [Target] ([✓/❌] [Actual result])
- [Metric 2]: [Target] ([✓/❌] [Actual result])

Closes: [Issue reference if applicable]
Refs: FEAT-XXX
```

### Phase 3: Post-Implementation Review and Follow-up Planning

#### 3.1 Immediate Review (Within 1 week)

**Functionality Verification**:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Performance within acceptable bounds
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Documentation complete and accurate

**Initial User Feedback**:
- Monitor original feedback channels
- Check for immediate user adoption
- Address any urgent issues or concerns

#### 3.2 30-Day Review

**Success Metrics Assessment**:
- Compare actual achievements vs. target metrics
- Document any gaps and reasons for variance
- Assess user adoption and feedback sentiment

**Enhancement Prioritization**:
- Review discovered follow-up opportunities
- Assess new user requests related to the feature
- Prioritize enhancements based on impact and effort

**Process Improvements**:
- What worked well in the implementation?
- What could be improved for future features?
- Update this workflow based on learnings

#### 3.3 Follow-up Document Creation

Create comprehensive follow-up document in `docs-internal/features/`:

**Required Sections**:
1. **Feature Summary**: What was delivered and why
2. **Success Metrics Assessment**: Actual vs. target achievements  
3. **Enhancement Opportunities**: Prioritized list of next steps
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Phased approach for enhancements
5. **Maintenance Requirements**: Ongoing tasks and resource needs
6. **Success Tracking**: KPIs and review schedule

## Implementation Tools and Templates

### TodoWrite Integration

For complex features, use TodoWrite throughout implementation:

```python
# Initial planning phase
TodoWrite([
    {"content": "Analyze user feedback and define problem scope", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"content": "Research technical solutions and constraints", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Design architecture and data structures", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Implement core functionality", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Add comprehensive testing", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Create documentation and examples", "status": "pending"},
    {"content": "Conduct post-implementation review", "status": "pending"}
])
```

### Feature Brief Template Location

Save feature briefs in: `docs-internal/features/FEAT-XXX-[name]-brief.md`

### Follow-up Document Template Location  

Save follow-up documents in: `docs-internal/features/FEAT-XXX-[name]-followup.md`
