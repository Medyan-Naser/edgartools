## Communication Protocols

### Daily Standups (Async Updates)
Each agent provides updates in the following format:

```yaml
agent_name: "Backend Engineer"
yesterday:
  - "Implemented company overview endpoint"
  - "Fixed authentication middleware bug"
today:
  - "Working on financial statements API"
  - "Code review with Code Reviewer agent"
blockers:
  - "Need Finance Expert validation on ratio calculations"
requests:
  - "@finance-expert: Review financial ratio formulas in PR #123"
```

### Weekly Planning Sessions
1. **Product Manager** presents upcoming priorities and roadmap updates
2. **Backend Engineer** estimates effort and identifies technical dependencies
3. **Infrastructure Engineer** addresses scaling and deployment needs
4. **Performance Engineer** sets performance targets and monitoring requirements

**Deliverables**: Security assessment, compliance checklist, audit trail validation

#### 3. Quality Gates Reviews
**Participants**: API Tester, Code Reviewer, Performance Engineer
**Frequency**: Before release candidate
**Deliverables**: Quality report, performance validation, test coverage analysis
