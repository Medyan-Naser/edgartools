- Ability to reference user feedback and support requests

## Example Agent Prompts

### For Requirement Analysis
```
"Analyze this user request and break it into structured tasks using the EdgarTools task planning framework. Consider the target user personas, technical constraints, and project goals. Provide specific acceptance criteria and effort estimates."
```

### For Feature Prioritization
```
"Review these feature requests and provide a prioritized roadmap. Consider user impact, implementation complexity, alignment with project goals, and resource constraints. Create structured tasks for the highest priority items."
```

### For Task Quality Review
```
"Review this task documentation and ensure it meets PM standards: clear business value, specific acceptance criteria, realistic estimates, and proper categorization. Suggest improvements where needed."
```

## Integration Examples

### Creating a New Feature Task
```python
# User input: "Users want to visualize financial trends over time"

# PM Agent analyzes and creates:
FEAT-015: Financial Trend Visualization API
- Business Value: Enables analysts to identify patterns quickly
- User Story: As a financial analyst, I want to visualize revenue/profit trends so that I can identify growth patterns and anomalies
- Acceptance Criteria: 
  - API endpoint accepts company CIK and time period
  - Returns structured data suitable for plotting
  - Handles missing quarters gracefully
  - Performance < 3 seconds for 5-year trends
- Dependencies: Company Facts API (FEAT-001)
- Effort Estimate: 5 days
- Success Metrics: 60% of API users adopt trend visualization within 30 days
```

### Converting Bug Report to Structured Task
```python
# User report: "Sometimes get weird errors when parsing filings"

# PM Agent investigates and creates:
BUG-008: Improve Error Messages for Filing Parsing Failures
- Business Impact: Users can't debug issues, leads to support burden
- User Story: As a developer using EdgarTools, I want clear error messages when parsing fails so that I can fix my code or report actionable bugs
- Root Cause Analysis Plan: [detailed investigation steps]
- Success Criteria: 
  - All parsing errors include actionable guidance
  - Error messages include company CIK and filing type
  - 80% reduction in "unclear error" support requests
```

## Why This Agent is Needed

### Current Gap
EdgarTools currently lacks systematic requirement analysis and task structuring. The existing `general-purpose` agent can do this work but lacks:
- Deep domain knowledge of financial data users
- Structured approach to task breakdown
- Focus on business value and user experience
- Integration with product planning workflows

### Expected Benefits
1. **Faster Development**: Clear requirements reduce implementation time
2. **Better User Alignment**: Features that actually solve user problems
3. **Reduced Rework**: Proper upfront analysis prevents scope creep
4. **Improved Quality**: Clear acceptance criteria ensure complete features
5. **Strategic Focus**: Prioritization based on business value

### ROI Justification
- **Time Savings**: 25% reduction in requirement clarification cycles
- **Quality Improvement**: 40% fewer post-release issue reports
- **User Satisfaction**: Better feature-market fit through proper analysis
- **Team Efficiency**: Developers can focus on implementation vs. requirement interpretation
